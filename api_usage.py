API Usage

The three fields below need to be filled in and are currently hardcoded:
file_name: The SQLite file to investigate (and associated WAL file if it exists in the same directory)
table_name: The table in the file to create a signature of and carve against the SQLite file with.
column_names: The columns in the table we are interested in printing out carved data from.

Note:  Below will carve entries from the b-tree page of the table and the freelists.  The use case of cross b-tree
       carving is not yet implemented yet in SQLite Dissect.
